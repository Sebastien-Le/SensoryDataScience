# The Questionnaire: Free JAR Profiling

- Sorting of the 10 fabric samples in three hedonic categories: "I like very much", "I like moderately" and "I don't like"
- Within each hedonic category, description of each product. The consumers are free to use their own words, but are prompted to structure their description through the use of terms such as "too much", "not enough" and "just right", in the spirit of JAR scales.
