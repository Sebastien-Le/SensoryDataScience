---

# Definition (Wikipedia)

<span style="font-weight : bold">Sound branding</span> (also known as audio branding, music branding, sonic branding, acoustic branding or sonic mnemonics) is the use of sound to reinforce brand identity.

Sound branding is increasingly becoming a vehicle for conveying a memorable message to targeted consumers, taking advantage of the powerful memory sense of sound.

# The Sennheiser case study

- Yup that’s right, you can win up to 35,000 Euros if your “sound logo” is selected as Sennheiser’s top entry.

- What’s a sound logo? As the name suggests, sound logos are to the ear what a visual symbol is to the eye. 

- Sennheiser is looking for audio enthusiasts around the globe to define exactly what Sennheiser’s sound logo should sound like.

# The Sennheiser case study

- Jérôme Quadri’s sound logo perfectly reflects the characteristics of the Sennheiser brand, said Susanne Seidel, president of global marketing at Sennheiser. “It is outstandingly clear, instantly recognisable and has great potential for variation.”

- “I wanted to compose a sound logo that is very simple and precise but at the same time sounds familiar and warm.”

- “For that reason, I decided to record only one instrument and to work with very few notes. I wanted to express familiarity through the warm, full sound of the piano. The melody is short, which makes it easy to remember, and it can also be easily adapted for different instruments.”
