# On the impact of Goji berries in the liking and typicity of multi-fruit juices

---

# Definition

<span style="font-weight : bold">Goji berry</span> is a small elongated orange berry that has been cultivated for thousands of years in the Himalayas for its nutritional value. This is one of the most naturally nutritious foods in the world, hence its classification as a "superfruit". It is a very important source of antioxidants but also rich in vitamins, minerals and trace elements. Thanks to this rich composition, Goji would allow, among other things, to lower blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels. It is also presented as effective against fatigue and immune weakness.
